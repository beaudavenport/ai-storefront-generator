# AI Storefront Generator

### A contribution to the [Gatsby Silly Site Challenge 2020](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/silly-site-challenge/)


#### How it works


AI Storefront Generator leverages Google's NLP API to analyze the contents of a provided prompt (in markdown format),
then build an e-commerce storefront for the prompt (with AI-generated images, descriptions, reviews, etc. powered by Deep AI).

All of the above takes place using Gatsby's Node API at **build time**, ultimately producing a series of static, deployable storefronts.

#### Contributions welcome!


You can add your own storefront by submitting a basic pull request, adding a new prompt file with your name, github, a tagline for the entry, and the actual text content.

Before contributing, test out the analysis of your prompt's text content here:

In particular, an analysis with a variety of "CONSUMER_GOOD" entries will produce a more feature-rich storefront. A new prompt addition will also rebuild all other storefronts, with slightly different images, descriptions, etc!
