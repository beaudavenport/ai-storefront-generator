REUTERS/Ahmed Abedini/Pool\n\nThe U.S. forces' presence in Baghdad is expected to be a crucial factor in the upcoming Iraqi elections.\n\nIn a statement on Sunday evening, U.S. Special Representative for Near East Policy Jim Mattis said the operation was also a \"tough, robust and effective move\" \"for the international community to secure Iraq's transition to a democratic system of governance, and restore security and stability\".\n\n\"As we look ahead to elections that will give the Iraqi people the sense of security they deserve in their country, the U.S. has a responsibility to do just that,\" he said.\n\nBut the Pentagon had no immediate plans for a briefing of the top U.S. officials, he wrote.\n\n\"We expect them to present a clear choice in the form of an urgent joint statement to the Iraqi government,\" Mattis wrote. \"As such, we are deeply committed to working with the Iraqi government to restore basic security and stability to this country, and we will have a wide range of activities in the event of a prompt, successful, and successful response.\"\n\nThe U.S. has been using force to bolster its support for the government in Baghdad for at least two years. It is also negotiating with Iran to stop its nuclear programs.\n\nSome of the more than 5,000 troops, advisers and personnel deployed in the fight against ISIS, were taken over by the Islamic State group, but the group has taken to attacking other coalition-savvy localities and areas including Iraq itself.\n\nU.S. officials declined to discuss what that operation might mean for the Iraqi peace effort, and what military advice the U.S. administration receives from Iraqi officials.<|endoftext|>The Senate Finance Committee on Thursday approved a bill that would force major tech companies to provide tax codes for the companies to take advantage of tax law changes they have implemented.\n\nThe legislation, Senate Bill 1107, which was approved on Thursday by the House Finance Committee, would force tech giants, including Alphabet, Google, Uber, Xandr, Amazon, and Apple to provide tax rules for tech companies using tax havens to avoid collecting tax returns.\n\nThe bill also would prohibit companies from getting in-house tax-coddling lawmakers using the tax code to tax companies. A provision to bolster the legislation was amended.\n\nThe bill was widely supported in the tech world, although it was blocked in April by the Senate, according to a letter from House Finance Chairman Peter Navarro of New York.\n\n\"The House bill repeals the federal subsidy rule and eliminates the rule which permits the federal government to pay tax on any amount of business tax deduction (EITC) for the tax deduction to be paid in accordance with law,\" Navarro said in the letter to the committee. \"This legislation will create even more loopholes in the tax deduction and allow these industries to operate under a taxable, more equitable, regulatory or tax free set of rules.\"\n\nThe bill contains two provisions that are expected to have been advanced to the Senate. These are known as the Tax Section 1535 and the exemption for companies that \"exceed the income tax rate or dividends set by the tax department under this section to be paid on earnings not earned in excess of that taxable income.\" The new provision would require a specific tax rate of 12 percent that is paid annually.\n\nThe bill is aimed at reducing the rate set by manufacturers and retailers but would also allow businesses to use existing rules for paying sales tax at a lower rate than they are paid in existing EITC exemptions.\n\nCompanies would not be able to spend up to $10 billion over five years to implement tax changes they want to make to the new tax code. The bill states that manufacturers could now use the new exemption to pay wages as a percentage of income. Instead of doing that, they would be required to pay income taxes as a percentage. The bill would also ensure that corporations","reviewer":"Pippy Streeter"}]}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
