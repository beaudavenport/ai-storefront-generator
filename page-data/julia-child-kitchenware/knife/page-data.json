REUTERS/Ahmed Abedini/Pool\n\nThe U.S. forces' presence in Baghdad is expected to be a crucial factor in the upcoming Iraqi elections.\n\nIn a statement on Sunday evening, U.S. Special Representative for Near East Policy Jim Mattis said the operation was also a \"tough, robust and effective move\" \"for the international community to secure Iraq's transition to a democratic system of governance, and restore security and stability\".\n\n\"As we look ahead to elections that will give the Iraqi people the sense of security they deserve in their country, the U.S. has a responsibility to do just that,\" he said.\n\nBut the Pentagon had no immediate plans for a briefing of the top U.S. officials, he wrote.\n\n\"We expect them to present a clear choice in the form of an urgent joint statement to the Iraqi government,\" Mattis wrote. \"As such, we are deeply committed to working with the Iraqi government to restore basic security and stability to this country, and we will have a wide range of activities in the event of a prompt, successful, and successful response.\"\n\nThe U.S. has been using force to bolster its support for the government in Baghdad for at least two years. It is also negotiating with Iran to stop its nuclear programs.\n\nSome of the more than 5,000 troops, advisers and personnel deployed in the fight against ISIS, were taken over by the Islamic State group, but the group has taken to attacking other coalition-savvy localities and areas including Iraq itself.\n\nU.S. officials declined to discuss what that operation might mean for the Iraqi peace effort, and what military advice the U.S. administration receives from Iraqi officials.<|endoftext|>The Senate Finance Committee on Thursday approved a bill that would force major tech companies to provide tax codes for the companies to take advantage of tax law changes they have implemented.\n\nThe legislation, Senate Bill 1107, which was approved on Thursday by the House Finance Committee, would force tech giants, including Alphabet, Google, Uber, Xandr, Amazon, and Apple to provide tax rules for tech companies using tax havens to avoid collecting tax returns.\n\nThe bill also would prohibit companies from getting in-house tax-coddling lawmakers using the tax code to tax companies. A provision to bolster the legislation was amended.\n\nThe bill was widely supported in the tech world, although it was blocked in April by the Senate, according to a letter from House Finance Chairman Peter Navarro of New York.\n\n\"The House bill repeals the federal subsidy rule and eliminates the rule which permits the federal government to pay tax on any amount of business tax deduction (EITC) for the tax deduction to be paid in accordance with law,\" Navarro said in the letter to the committee. \"This legislation will create even more loopholes in the tax deduction and allow these industries to operate under a taxable, more equitable, regulatory or tax free set of rules.\"\n\nThe bill contains two provisions that are expected to have been advanced to the Senate. These are known as the Tax Section 1535 and the exemption for companies that \"exceed the income tax rate or dividends set by the tax department under this section to be paid on earnings not earned in excess of that taxable income.\" The new provision would require a specific tax rate of 12 percent that is paid annually.\n\nThe bill is aimed at reducing the rate set by manufacturers and retailers but would also allow businesses to use existing rules for paying sales tax at a lower rate than they are paid in existing EITC exemptions.\n\nCompanies would not be able to spend up to $10 billion over five years to implement tax changes they want to make to the new tax code. The bill states that manufacturers could now use the new exemption to pay wages as a percentage of income. Instead of doing that, they would be required to pay income taxes as a percentage. The bill would also ensure that corporations","reviewer":"Jobey Vala"},{"review":" found it was \"not technically a killing weapon\"\n\nFeds raid Sri Lanka's Patna office, after ruling that it was used\n\nThe United Nations has said the country is \"no longer to blame\" for the killing of Sri Lankan army soldiers, a senior UN diplomat said.\n\n\"While UN observers say that the government has murdered Sri Lankan soldiers with brutality that you found unacceptable, no country is the only country which stands between the execution of justice and the alleged victims, all of which should be realised and confirmed.\n\n\"If we are to consider a country to stand up for justice – we would move quickly to clear the blame for the killing at the United Nations,\" Mr Choudhary said.\n\n(Image: BBC news agency)\n\n\"A justice is never finished. But in accordance with our commitments, the government of the country has already been handed over to the victims of human rights abuses, from police killing in the streets to torture,\" he said.\n\n\"The leaders of the country will continue to conduct human rights matters on behalf of the rest of the Sri Lankan people, until we reach the end of the war in a desperate way.\"\n\nPresident Sri Lanka's last president, ended years of Sri Lanka's human rights record under the country's 1998 ceasefire campaign.\n\nMr. Choudhary said, \"I want to thank our UN colleagues, the Filipino people, for their support and in particular for the government's courageous response and their willingness and tireless effort.\n\n\"A response in the US about a recent 14-20 mission about such things is now consistent with the government of Sri Lanka,\" he said.\n\nOn Friday, the government at UN in New York said the death toll could rise to 3,\n\n4, which shows that military forces were the weakest to carry out the \"death, imprisonment, execution and torture\" mission.\n\nThe UN general staff condemned the \"cruel and inhumanity to execute\" human rights inspectors who found the bodies of 10 Tamil sailors, which included a soldier killed in the hands of an Israeli hard line.\n\nThe UN secretary general John Baird announced that Myanmar may be the next member of the UN security council in September, but that it cannot join \"other countries\".\n\nThe report by Jason Tambor shows that six UN leaders have said the government of Sri Lanka should not yield to pressure from Tamil President Mahinda Rajapaksa to keep the country working under international pressure, no longer \"abandoning\" the government to do what he called \"killing traditional Tamil\" victims and not doing what he called \"victory\".\n\nIt comes after the UN panel of UN experts released a number of recommendations for military reforms in the response to the 1971 unrest.\n\nThe UN chief of staff called on the government of Sri Lanka to make a \"serious correction\" to the army, a decision that the government of Sri Lanka has made.\n\nThe government has put a mission on notice the mission is not pursuing an investigation into the issue of the death. The UN is a non-government body that has been formed as part of the mission.\n\nMr. Choudhary said it was imperative for the security of the Government of Sri Lanka and national security forces in this response.<|endoftext|>As I noted yesterday, the timing, the consequences and the failure to have somebody with the most complicated bill in DC I didn't agree. It was a good way to do something like this: the GOP has to go back to being pretty and win the elections but Republicans are running on \"Protecting States Before Spying!\" a lie that's out there in many, many, of these examples, lies.\n\nBut it's not really how the Republicans envision things in the election campaign, and not something that happens every election year. But instead the GOP wants to keep Democrats in charge for the election and redistricting in 2021, and if that goes well with the 2018 rules, its most important election day objective -- and the only vote Congress has the right to take -- is 2020.\n\nIt's true that after the Senate election in 2020 there is little chance that the Democrats lose a House majority that they still have plenty of votes to gain. But when you look at what would go wrong at the Senate, not the House in that order, it is clear that even if a party were to lose its majority, no one would have an idea. If a party could have none of the support it's expected to have, or could have an interest in cutting deficits, there's no reason to believe that they could have a majority of at least one of the votes that they would need to pass their budget. So even if the Republicans had no majority, they might want to try to keep a much bigger and wider majority on the bench in 2021 than they did in 2010.\n\nI have spoken to hundreds of people I met in my capacity as a Republican. The most I've met. The entire party was like what you","reviewer":"Barry Ley"}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
