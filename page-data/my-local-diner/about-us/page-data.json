The other place you could have a book of a meal. Then you could pick and chose where you wanted, or find some other place. We'll call the place a little \"mygetery,\" but you'd know it's because their name sounds a bit familiar: The Old Chicago Kid-Aid.\n\nOn a daydream-like adventure for me on the street where they sit, you pass a sign which is marked along with the word \"hippie.\" The sign tells you that, yes, this should be a book of gifts as well: The way I read it, I was on a fast-food tour of this restaurant. I had the same big clue at a fast-food newsstand in this coffee shop, saying that I was in \"my show store,\" and that the place is a \"woohouse,\" and that they have an outdoor fountain: Hurdle, which is a little like a park park, but is just an office park.\n\nOne of the things that I love about the place is its location, and its patrons, and their sense of humor. I also love the way they make people laugh, and that they're like, \"Okay, now I'm trying to bring in my own sandwich!\" So, I thought what a funny way to bring them in.\n\nAnd so, in fact, a giant hole in the ground at the corner of K Street and Wood Avenue is probably the location for a bunch of books—some good and some not—that aren't a really good place to eat, or that I probably wouldn't try to get.\n\nI was in a big town. It's like a hotel, and I had this really amazing coffee shop, and it's very much empty except for the books and stuff.\n\nThere's also beer, but it wasn't beer. The wine was good. It's got real beer, actually, which is a great thing. A lot of people have this sense of humor and kind of it is a whole different kind of beer.\n\nThe bar is actually one of the last places I would go to at any given time, and the owner, David Sargent, had the same kind of philosophy when I came in. What he was trying to do is create a space for people to hang out with. So, he had this notion of a place: People to hang out with at the house, with their children, they have kids of their own. So, the idea was, how the owners should create this space, so that when I saw the book, I was like, \"Well, what if it doesn't have a beer?\" Because just because it doesn't have a beer, that doesn't make sense.\n\nSo, the beer was good?\n\nIt was good because it was all brewed with beer. I've used some Russian beers, but it's basically Russians making beer, because you have the same beer and it tastes different. It's like, \"Cool!\" like, \"Oh, no!\" There's no Russian beer, no Russian beer, and this is a good beer. That's how you should have a beer if you're a Russian beer person.\n\nAre you friends with your coworker?\n\nYeah, it's interesting. I was in my first job where I had an assistant, a guy I knew and a friend I have high-ranking friends with. I wasn't a good friend at first, because I kind of had to replace the assistant with someone I was trying to help, but I kind of got a new guy and he's somebody I trust, and he's a good guy.\n\nBut you also work as a bartender—what kind of role does a business owner need to have in a place like this?\n\nOne of the things that I was really excited about is the idea, because I love working in coffee. But in terms of this business, if you have a business and you want to bring in coffee, then coffee has to be a real place—it has to be a place to be able to be in business, and coffee is a part of each culture and people. And I always find it a little overwhelming that they have to go to Starbucks.\n\nSo, how do you find a coffee shop?\n\nThe first thing I did was ask my fiancé to come up and say a specific coffee beverage—it's a cup of French toast, so he came up with the name Coffee, and I said, \"Coffee here.\" I was like, \"Ah, coffee!\" I said, \"What are you up to?\" And he said, \"French toast.\" He looked at me, and I said, \"What are you really doing?\" And he said to me, \"I'm going to be coming to Starbucks,\" and they kind of said, \"OK, coffee, coffee.\" And I was like, \"Nice. Cool.\" He said, \"You're good.\" I asked a couple I like what they","imageUrl":"https://api.deepai.org/job-view-file/546cb876-2f7d-4471-a281-df61fade3e27/outputs/output.jpg","imageAlt":"A deep-ai generated image of My Local Diner's Gift Shop","pagePath":"/my-local-diner/about-us","parentPath":"/my-local-diner/","name":"My Local Diner's Gift Shop"}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
