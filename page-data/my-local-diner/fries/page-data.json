That's enough for six million in the United States, and half in the United Kingdom and a half in the U.S. This is probably enough to make you wonder where all of this was happening.\n\nHere's the official White House statement on gun violence in 2017:\n\nThe President of the United States is purposefully not releasing his White House statement until further notice. This is an extraordinary opportunity to reflect on the way we live with guns. On Friday, May 8 2017, at the dedication of President Trump's Resolute Support of America Summit in Washington D.C., I received the following information concerning this White House statement\n\n\"During the course of the Summit, President Donald Trump posted a photo of himself as armed with a gun, which we are sharing at the same moment as the latest ISIS attack in France. From then on, the President also posted the statement on his Twitter \"White House press release\" that included the statement\n\n\"I have received the following text messages regarding this White House statement... A press release, the original statement, the new statement and the release of the media release. I am glad to have reached out to the President of the United States and his supporters who have always supported me.\"\n\nI just wanted to thank them for bringing this wonderful opportunity into our media spotlight and explaining to people who have ever known Donald Trump that his words will never be heard. I am extremely grateful for their efforts and support towards me.\n\nPresident Trump posted a short statement in which he said, \"Let me thank my friends and my allies. I look forward to working with my fellow countrymen on new national security details, along with my team of reporters. I hope to continue to fulfill my duties as President-elect and to be a strong leader in the world. I also recognize that at this difficult time for nearly 1 million Americans and our allies around the globe, we have a new and significant responsibility to work closely together with the United States.\"\n\nThe statements in this particular tweet are clearly a good way to convey that Donald Trump is just as smart as all of the others in the White House. To put it simply, he was not a \"reporter.\" He was a businessman.\n\nTrump's Twitter statement and photo usage (in this case, \"reporter.org\" is the most common form) indicate he never heard other media outlets report on his remarks until he made them. Of course, given the sheer size of his personal profile, I would like to offer this explanation.\n\nI apologize to @the_donald for the photo, but as an artist that was the only way to access the presidential press office is a pretty difficult job, and I will be glad to share with you the same photo that has been passed along to a source close to my presidency... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2017\n\nBut that's it for today. You should tweet it out and share with your friends. I want to thank them for their efforts and support to have all of our stories highlighted and shared in the United States. I apologize for the photo, or for any other of the stories you may have told that I have conveyed to you by the person who created the photo and for the photos I posted without giving them permission, and for any subsequent pictures and stories I published.\n\nNow, to be clear, a press release issued by the president of the United States, stating President Trump is \"no longer a Republican\" is a pretty normal photo. This is an extraordinary opportunity to express hope that Americans will love the country.<|endoftext|>(CNN) President"},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/ai-storefront-generator/static/00e337a70f73f148fff74564c1a96646/49b36/output.jpg","srcSet":"/ai-storefront-generator/static/00e337a70f73f148fff74564c1a96646/f836f/output.jpg 200w,\n/ai-storefront-generator/static/00e337a70f73f148fff74564c1a96646/2244e/output.jpg 400w,\n/ai-storefront-generator/static/00e337a70f73f148fff74564c1a96646/49b36/output.jpg 512w","sizes":"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"}}}}},"pageContext":{"type":"Product","pagePath":"/my-local-diner/fries","parentPath":"/my-local-diner/","productName":"fries","productPrice":"$94.99","productDescription":"fries are more likely to be found on a specific site (see: \"A Guide to Recent Sites\"), and one could argue that these sites are therefore more likely to be for a very specific user.
