This is a lot of text about potatoes, orange juice, breakfast cereal, and the like. I think it is my favorite meal of the day. Any time I am given the choice between pizza or cheerios, you better believe I'm going to pick the cheerios. Pancakes, hash browns, coffee - I want all of it all the time. Breakfast is the best.
