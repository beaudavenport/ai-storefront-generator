Theoretically a good cook should be able to perform under any cir- 
cumstances, but cooking is much easier, pleasanter, and more efficient if you 
have the right tools. Good equipment which will last for years does not seem 
outrageously expensive when you realize that a big, enameled-iron casserole 
costs no more than a 6-rib roast, that a large enameled skillet can be bought for 
the price of a leg of lamb, and that a fine paring knife may cost less than two 
small lamb chops. One of the best places to shop for reasonably priced kitchen- 
ware is in a hotel- and restaurant-supply house where objects are sturdy, pro- 
fessional, and made for hard use.
