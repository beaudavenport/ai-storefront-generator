Yuck.

So, I am trying to find a place to wander to after I go to my favorite bookstore for a spiffy event. My friend suggests we go to the Buttery, because it'll be open. Sure enough, it was. That is about where the good ends.

You know that STANK people have in their house if they don't clean up after their cats? Ok, imagine if the cats were made of fake, theater-popcorn-like butter, and you'd owned them for 50 years, and never cleaned it up. Somewhere here you will have an idea of what this place smelled like. It was so noxious I lost my appetite.

However, being the soldier that I am, I still checked out a burger (yeah, coz it's me), some fries and a chocolate shake.

The chocolate shake was not blended all the way - because the ice cream had some gnarly freezer burn. The fries were hot, but neither tasty nor potato like (The best that can be said about them was the temperature - they tasted like fake butter, too). The burger was...well, I'd rather a McDonalds burger. The buns were poor quality, the meat was not even what I would actually consider to be meat, and it was sooooo greasy that even I was disgusted. And I'm a fried food and burger advocate. Well, ok, I'm a good food advocate, but grease doesn't usually scare me.

The waiter was a nice guy - doing what he could. Thank GOD my friend owed me dinner so I didn't have to pay for it. I am at home now with a stomach ache.

Yuck. Yuck yuck yuck.
